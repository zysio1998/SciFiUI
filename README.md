# Description of the assignment
Its a solar system where the 8 planets are roating around the sun which is stationary. The 9 planets are shown on the left hand side in a column and when you click one, a big image appers with an interesting description of the planet clicked.

# Instructions

Click a one planet at a time. before you want to see the next one you have to UNCLICK the one you clicked otherwise it will not work

# How it works

When you click on the planet a mousePressed function detects the click of the mouse in the Perimeter defined eg. (ui.mouseX > xrect-10 && ui.mouseX < xrect +10 && ui.mouseY > (yrect*2) +30 && ui.mouseY < (yrect*2) +50). From left X -10 to Right X +10 so you have 20 pixels allowance to press it then from top Y +30 to bottom Y +50 you have 20 pixels allowance to press it too. So basically it allows you to press in the 20*20 perimeter. Once clicked a bigger image is called and displayed simuletanously the CSV is already loaded and called row by row and displayed on the screen.


# What I am most proud of in the assignment
The layout of the big image and CSV file when the images are clicked
